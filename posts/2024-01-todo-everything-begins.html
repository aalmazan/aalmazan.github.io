<p>New year, more personal projects to procrastinate on.</p>
<p>A few years ago I thought an idea called "TODO Everything" which can be summed up as "The TODO app that does
everything." I had ideas of grandeur where it would have every feature imaginable; integrate a bunch of different
services; <em>be</em> a bunch of different services; have complex backend systems that would do anything you need. It's an
insane idea, and I always loved thinking
about it. Essentially, it's something like a "Scope Creep Simulator", or maybe the absolute opposite of
what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">code golf</a> is.</p>
<p>The purpose of Todo apps is pretty simple: people need toy/example/test apps to build, especially when learning a new
language/framework/platform/etcetera. In the web app world there's a few that come to mind: blogs, social media clones,
and Todo apps. Essentially, they're just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> apps with
a database (or some type of data storage) that can maybe have multiple users and maybe a few actions can be done (i.e.
completing a Todo item, or liking a post). That's it.</p>
<p>Of course, you'd want the scope to be minimal since you're just learning your shiny new language or tool, but it can get
exponentially more interesting when you silence your inner <em>Project Manager/Lead Developer</em> and tell yourself, "You know
what? We <em>can</em> add a few more weeks to this feature in order to get it working on a local Kubernetes cluster running on
your Raspberry Pis."</p>
<p>So, a month or so ago that's what I did. I've engineered myself into corners and bulldozed those walls to create even
more corners, but it has been interesting and mostly fun to work on. Will this be a major start up that will change
people's lives for the better and solve global healthcare? No. 99.999% guaranteed to do nothing, but some learning's
getting done, maybe it'll help other people as well.</p>
<p>I've created the GitHub organization <a href="https://github.com/todo-everything">todo-everything</a> that will house everything
"TODO: Everything" (actual "real" name not confirmed). So far the following are up in mostly working condition with an
infinity of features left to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Backend written in Python + Django. Mainly using Django for its ORM
  and <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/"><code>django-rest-framework</code></a><ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/todo-everything/todo-everything-django">https://github.com/todo-everything/todo-everything-django</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A frontend written in TypeScript using <a href="https://www.solidjs.com/">SolidJS</a> and <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> (
  the <code>solid-ts</code> vite template). This was written first to get a feel for
  the API. Probably should be written later, but that's a story for a different post.<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/todo-everything/todo-everything-solid">https://github.com/todo-everything/todo-everything-solid</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another frontend written TypeScript using <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>, <a href="https://swc.rs/">SWC</a> and
  also <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> (<code>react-swc-ts</code> template).<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/todo-everything/todo-everything-react">https://github.com/todo-everything/todo-everything-react</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everything OPs related. So far just some Ansible and Kubernetes files, but it also supports ARM because of Raspberry
  Pis.<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/todo-everything/todo-everything-ops">https://github.com/todo-everything/todo-everything-ops</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've learned more in the past few months than I have even in some other jobs since it's completely void of any
"business" and "logic". At least for now. Hah, but no this will almost never be a viable business idea. I do have a
feature idea for <code>todo-everything</code>, though, that would integrate Stripe (initially) charge a user a metered rate for
each Todo item the create and complete. Another very wild idea, but I think I've actually seen a variant of that on an
existing iOS Todo app... Future post ideas are abundant, but that's the end of this one for now.</p>
<p>Dreaming big and making my backlog infinite when time is very much limited. This is 2024.</p>
